"""
Local wake-word detection for NEO.

WHAT IS ACTUALLY AVAILABLE, STATED PLAINLY
    openwakeword ships small pretrained ONNX models. The only one this build
    ships against is its pretrained wake phrase, "hey jarvis" — there is no
    NEO-trained model in existence, and this module will not pretend otherwise.
    The model name is therefore a SETTING (wake_word_model) with that pretrained
    name as its default, and the phrase the user is told to say is a separate
    setting (wake_phrase) that follows the model.

    Point wake_word_model at any other openwakeword model you have on disk and
    the detector uses it; point it at a model that is not on disk and is_ready()
    reports False, so the UI offers the download instead of silently listening
    for something else. Nothing here fabricates a wake word that does not work.

Design goals:
  • ZERO cost when the feature is off — openwakeword is imported ONLY inside
    start()/install helpers, never at module load. If the user never enables
    wake word, none of this touches the app.
  • ZERO latency on the audio path — the microphone callback only ever does a
    cheap, non-blocking queue push (feed()); the actual model inference runs in
    this module's own background thread, so the real-time audio thread and the
    Gemini stream are never slowed.
  • Fully local & offline — audio fed here never leaves the machine; there is no
    network call except the one-time model download the user triggers from the UI.

openwakeword ships small ONNX models (a few MB each) and runs comfortably on a
CPU. The pretrained wake phrase used here is "Hey Jarvis".
